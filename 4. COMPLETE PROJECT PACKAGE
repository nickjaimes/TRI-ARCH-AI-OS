Executive Summary

The Tri‑Arch Supercomputer represents a paradigm shift in high‑performance computing by integrating three fundamentally different processor architectures into a single, unified system:

· Classical high‑performance computing (HPC) nodes for general‑purpose tasks and orchestration.
· Photonic AI accelerators (Q.ANT Native Processing Servers) for ultra‑efficient, low‑latency neural network inference and nonlinear operations.
· Photonic quantum processors (ORCA PT‑1, QuEra Aquila) for solving complex optimisation and quantum simulation problems.

All three domains are managed by the TAOS (Tri‑Arch Operating System) , a distributed meta‑OS that abstracts hardware heterogeneity, provides a unified programming model (TAOS‑QL / CUDA‑Q), and ensures efficient resource scheduling across the entire facility. This document provides the complete project package, from architectural blueprints and implementation plans to operational guides and project management details, enabling stakeholders to build, deploy, and operate the world’s first true hybrid supercomputer.

Part II: Technical Architecture

2.1 Tri‑Arch Hardware Overview

The system comprises three physically separated domains connected via a high‑speed InfiniBand fabric.

Domain Node Count Primary Hardware Role
Classical 256 Intel Xeon Max + NVIDIA H200 Orchestration, general‑purpose compute
Photonic AI 64 Q.ANT NPS Gen2 (TFLNoI NPUs) AI acceleration, nonlinear ops

· Interconnect: NVIDIA Quantum‑2 InfiniBand (400 Gb/s), fully non‑blocking fat tree.

2.3 Photonic AI Acceleration Domain

· Node: Q.ANT Native Processing Server (NPS) Gen2 – 4U rackmount.
· Photonic core: Thin‑Film Lithium Niobate on Insulator (TFLNoI) chip.
· Interface: PCIe Gen4 x8, DMA engine with GPUDirect support.
· Performance: 8 GOPS per NPU, 30× lower energy than GPUs for nonlinear ops.
· Software: Q.PAL library with Python/C++ APIs, integration with PyTorch/TensorFlow.

2.4 Photonic Quantum Computing Domain

· ORCA PT‑1: Programmable bosonic sampling processor, 12 qubits, room‑temperature operation, 100 GbE control.
· QuEra Aquila: Neutral‑atom processor, 260 qubits, 2D grid topology, PCIe FPGA interface.
· Calibration: Automated recalibration every hour; coherence window >800 ns.

2.5 Interconnect & Physical Infrastructure

· Fabric: Redundant InfiniBand switches, 400 Gb/s spine‑leaf topology.
· Synchronisation: PTP grandmaster with nanosecond accuracy across domains.
· Power: 2.5 MW total (1.8 MW classical + 0.7 MW cooling/infrastructure).
· Cooling: Classical: liquid‑cooled; Photonic: passive; Quantum: active vibration isolation.

2.6 System Software: TAOS

TAOS is a distributed meta‑operating system with a hybrid microkernel architecture.

· Core components: Global Resource Scheduler (Slurm‑NG), Domain Servers (PAD for photonic AI, QOD for quantum), Unified Memory Manager.
· Key features:
  · Coherence‑aware scheduling (guarantees quantum job completion within decoherence limits).
  · Unified 128‑bit virtual address space spanning all memory types.
  · Fast context switching on photonic NPUs.
  · Hardware‑enforced isolation between tenants.

2.7 Programming Model (TAOS‑QL / CUDA‑Q)

Developers write hybrid applications using extended C++/Python with [[taos::quantum_kernel]] and [[taos::photonic_kernel]] attributes. The TAOS compiler (based on LLVM) partitions the code and generates executables for each domain, using CUDA‑Q as the quantum intermediate representation.

Example snippet:

```cpp
[[taos::hybrid]]
double solve(problem p) {
    auto features = classical_preprocess(p);
    auto encoding = photonic_convolution(features);
    quantum_kernel qaoa(encoding);
    return classical_postprocess(measure(qaoa));
}
```
